# FTIR-ML-Pipeline

FTIR-ML-Pipeline is a Python workflow for **classification of FTIR spectra** using
PLS-DA and other ML models, plus a **desktop GUI** for single-spectrum prediction.
The core idea is to compare a full-resolution representation of the spectrum with a
sparse, peak-based representation.

## Large Files (Google Drive)

Due to GitHub file size limits, some large assets are **not stored directly in this repository**.
They are available in a shared Google Drive folder, including:

- `training_data/spectras.csv` – full FTIR training dataset (4 replicates per compound)
- Example spectra for GUI testing (CSV files)
- Pre-trained model files (`*.pkl`), if you choose to share them
- Packaged GUI executable (e.g. `FTIRApp.zip`), if applicable
- A copy of the Uzbek registration / patent document

## Features

- Unified preprocessing (Savitzky–Golay, ALS baseline correction, area normalisation)
- Two feature types:
  - Full spectrum (500–3000 cm⁻¹)
  - Sparse peak features (percentile-based peak selection + binning)
- Training scripts for:
  - Full-resolution PLS-DA (`train_full.py`)
  - Sparse PLS-DA (`train_sparse.py`)
  - Extended benchmark with PLS-DA, XGBoost, RF, SVM (`train_sparse_all_models.py`)
- Benchmark scripts:
  - GUI-like latency for sparse model (`benchmark_gui_sparse.py`)
  - Full vs sparse inference speed & model size (`benchmark_two_models.py`)
- PyQt5 GUI (`app.py`) to load a CSV spectrum, plot it, run prediction and export a PDF report
- Reusable preprocessing utilities in `utils.py`
